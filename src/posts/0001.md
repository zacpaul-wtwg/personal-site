## AWS Guide Supplement
---
This tutorial serves as a supplement to the official [AWS guide on deploying a Next.js 13 app with authentication to AWS Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/mobile/deploy-a-next-js-13-app-with-authentication-to-aws-amplify/). If you've completed up to the third step of the AWS guide and have run `npm install aws-amplify @aws-amplify/ui-react`, you can proceed with the following steps.

## Directory Structure and Path Adjustments
---
> **Note**: This tutorial recommends using Next.js' `pages/` routing, as it is more widely documented compared to the new `app/` routing method.
- Delete the `src/app` folder.
- Create a new file `src/pages/_app.js` and paste the AWS tutorial content into it.
- Create another new file `src/pages/index.js` and paste the AWS tutorial content into it.
- Ensure that the import statement for `aws-exports.js` on line 3 of `_app.js` is correct.
- Create a new file `src/styles/global.css`.

## Git Setup
---
1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory.
2. Initialize a new Git repository with `git init`.
3. Stage your changes with `git add .`.
4. Commit your changes with `git commit -m "first commit"`.

> **GitHub**: For this tutorial, we'll use GitHub. Log in to your GitHub account and create a new repository. Do not include a README or `.gitignore` file.

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/{your-username}/{your-repo-name}.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Implementing Protected Routes
---
We'll modify the `_app.js` file to conditionally apply layouts based on the route. Routes starting with `/member` will be automatically protected.

### Update `_app.js`
```javascript
// File: src/pages/_app.js
import "@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css"
import { Amplify } from "aws-amplify"
import awsExports from "../aws-exports"
import "../styles/globals.css"
import PublicLayout from "../components/layouts/PublicLayout"
import MemberLayout from "../components/layouts/MemberLayout"

Amplify.configure({ ...awsExports, ssr: true })

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps, router }) {
  const isMemberRoute = router.pathname.startsWith("/member");
  let Layout = isMemberRoute ? MemberLayout : PublicLayout;
  return (
    <Layout>
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </Layout>
  );
}
export default MyApp;
```

### Create Layouts
Create the following layout components:
- `src/components/layouts/CommonLayout.js`
- `src/components/layouts/PublicLayout.js`
- `src/components/layouts/MemberLayout.js`

### Update `CommonLayout.js`
Paste code into file:

```javascript
import Navigation from "@ui/Navigation";

function CommonLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <Navigation />
      <div>
        <main>{children}</main>
      </div>
      <footer>{/* Your footer content */}</footer>
    </div>
  );
}
export default CommonLayout;
```

### Update `PublicLayout.js`
Paste code into file:
```javascript
import CommonLayout from "./CommonLayout";

function PublicLayout({ children }) {
  return <CommonLayout>{children}</CommonLayout>;
}
export default PublicLayout;
```

### Update `MemberLayout.js`
Paste code into file:

```javascript
import { withAuthenticator } from "@aws-amplify/ui-react";
import CommonLayout from "./CommonLayout";

function MemberLayoutContent({ children }) {
  return <CommonLayout>{children}</CommonLayout>;
}
const MemberLayout = withAuthenticator(MemberLayoutContent);
export default MemberLayout;
```

## Protecting Individual Components
To protect a specific component, you can use the `withAuthenticator` HOC as shown below:

```javascript
const yourProtectedComponent = withAuthenticator(yourProtectedComponentContent);
export default yourProtectedComponent;
```

By doing this, you are essentially creating a new component (`yourProtectedComponent`) that includes the authentication functionality. You then export this new component so it can be used in your application.
