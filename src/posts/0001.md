## Introduction to AWS Next.js 13 Deployment with Authentication
Welcome to this supplement to the official AWS guide on deploying a Next.js 13 app with authentication to AWS Amplify. If you've embarked on this journey of building modern web applications, you're in the right place. In this tutorial, we'll walk you through some essential steps and adjustments that will help you make the most of AWS Amplify while deploying your Next.js 13 app. Let's dive right in.

## Github Repository
[Vitruvian-Community Repo](https://github.com/zacpaul-wtwg/vitruvian-community)

While the repo includes a lot more code than what is walked-through in the following post, it does include a working version of these concepts. Who knows, there might be other stuff there that you'd want to use!

## Knowledge That Might Be Helpful
- Basic knowledge of web development concepts.
- Familiarity with JavaScript and React.
- Experience with using Node.js and npm.

## Knowledge That You'll Pick Up
- How to set up directory structure and path adjustments for a Next.js 13 app.
- Implementing protected routes based on route conditions.
- Creating a user context for managing user data.
- Developing layout components for structured application design.
- Deploying a secure `/member` route and extending protection to other routes.
- Utilizing AWS Amplify for authentication and serverless app deployment.
- Interacting with GitHub for version control and repository hosting.

## Things You'll Need
- A github account
- An AWS account

<!-- file structure changes go here -->
## Directory Structure and Path Adjustments
**Let's get these file structure changes out of the way first so we can focus on the code.**

Create a new file `src/pages/_app.js`
```bash
touch src/pages/_app.js
```

Create a new file `src/pages/index.js`
```bash
touch src/pages/index.js
```

Create a new file `src/styles/global.css`
```bash
touch src/styles/global.css
```

Create a new file `src/contexts/UserContext.js`
```bash
touch src/contexts/UserContext.js
```

Create the following layout components:
```bash
touch src/components/layouts/CommonLayout.js
touch src/components/layouts/PublicLayout.js
touch src/components/layouts/MemberLayout.js
```

**Delete the src/app folder**
```bash
rm -r src/app
```

<!-- original blog instructional goes here -->
## Version Control and Repository Setup
**Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory.**

Initialize a new Git repository with 
```bash
git init
```

Stage your changes with
```bash
git add .
```

Commit your changes with
```bash
git commit -m "first commit"
```

> **GitHub**: For this tutorial, we'll use GitHub. Log in to your GitHub account and create a new repository. Do not include a README or `.gitignore` file.

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/{your-username}/{your-repo-name}.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Conditionally Applying Layouts for Protecting Routes


We'll modify the `_app.js` file to conditionally apply layouts based on the route. Routes starting with `/member` will be automatically protected.


```javascript
// File: src/pages/_app.js
import "@aws-amplify/ui-react/styles.css"
import { Amplify } from "aws-amplify"
import awsExports from "../aws-exports"
import "../styles/globals.css"
import PublicLayout from "../components/layouts/PublicLayout"
import MemberLayout from "../components/layouts/MemberLayout"

Amplify.configure({ ...awsExports, ssr: true })

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps, router }) {
	const isMemberRoute = router.pathname.startsWith("/member")
	let Layout = isMemberRoute ? MemberLayout : PublicLayout

	return (
		<Layout {...pageProps}>
			<Component {...pageProps} />
		</Layout>
	)
}

export default MyApp

```

## Managing User Data with Context

We want our user data available in a lot of different places. While it would work you just pass props down into every component, let's update our user context so that you can access your user data without having to do so. 

Update `src/contexts/UserContext.js`

```
// src/contexts/UserContext.js
import React, { createContext, useState, useEffect } from "react"
import { Auth } from "aws-amplify"

export const UserContext = createContext()

export const UserProvider = ({ children }) => {
	const [user, setUser] = useState(null)

	useEffect(() => {
		Auth.currentAuthenticatedUser()
			.then((user) => setUser(user))
			.catch((err) => console.log(err))
	}, [])

	return (
		<UserContext.Provider value={{ user, setUser }}>
			{children}
		</UserContext.Provider>
	)
}

```
## Creating Layouts for Use in Protected Routes


### Building the Common Layout Component
Update `CommonLayout.js`



```javascript
// File path: src/components/layouts/CommonLayout.js
import React from "react"
import { UserProvider } from "../../contexts/UserContext"

function CommonLayout({ children, renderedAt }) {
	return (
		<UserProvider>
			<div>
				<p>Rendered at: {renderedAt}</p>
				{React.Children.map(children, (child) => {
					// Clone the child component and pass the additional props
					return React.cloneElement(child, { renderedAt })
				})}
			</div>
		</UserProvider>
	)
}

export default CommonLayout
```

### Crafting the Public Layout
Update `PublicLayout.js`



```javascript
// File path: src/components/layouts/PublicLayout.js

import CommonLayout from "./CommonLayout"

function PublicLayout({ children }) {
	return <CommonLayout>{children}</CommonLayout>
}
export default PublicLayout

```

### Implementing the Member Layout

Update `MemberLayout.js`



```javascript
// File path: src/components/MemberLayout.js
import { withAuthenticator } from "@aws-amplify/ui-react"
import CommonLayout from "./CommonLayout"

function MemberLayoutContent({ children, signOut }) {
	return (
		<CommonLayout>
			<div>
				<button onClick={signOut}>Sign out</button>
			</div>
			{children}
		</CommonLayout>
	)
}

const MemberLayout = withAuthenticator(MemberLayoutContent)
export default MemberLayout


```

Now, in `/pages`, create a member folder and put whatever page you want. This is what I have:

```javascript
// In Profile.js or any other component
import { useContext } from "react"
import { UserContext } from "../../contexts/UserContext"

function Profile() {
	const { user } = useContext(UserContext)
	return (
		<div style={{ padding: 50 }}>
			<h1>Logged in as {user ? user.username : "Loading..."}.</h1>
			<p>{user ? user.attributes.email : "Loading..."}</p>
			<p>{user ? user.attributes.sub : "Loading..."}</p>
			{console.log(user)}
		</div>
	)
}

export default Profile


```

As you can see, because we passed the user object down the layout tree as props, you have access to all the user data. If your user comments or posts, you can use the `user.attributes.sub` attribute as the immutable and unique user id/key.

Take a look at the console to check out what other information you have access to!

Congratulations, you now have a totally protected `/member` route! You can do this with as many routes as you want.

## Securing Specific Components with `withAuthenticator`

To protect a specific component, you can use the `withAuthenticator` HOC as shown below:

```javascript
const yourProtectedComponent = withAuthenticator(yourProtectedComponentContent);
export default yourProtectedComponent;
```

By doing this, you are essentially creating a new component (`yourProtectedComponent`) that includes the authentication functionality. You then export this new component so it can be used in your application.

## Wrapping It Up: A Protected `/member` Route for Your Next.js 13 App
And there you have it, a fully protected `/member` route and the flexibility to extend this to other routes as well. By creating a user context and utilizing layout components, you've not only secured your application but also made it more maintainable and scalable. Remember to explore the official documentation for Next.js, AWS Amplify, and GitHub to further enhance your skills. Happy coding, and may your web applications thrive!
