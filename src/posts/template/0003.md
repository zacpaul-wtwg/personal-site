In this post, we'll explore how to include code blocks in Markdown files.

## Including a Code Block

You can include code blocks in Markdown by wrapping your code with triple backticks. You can also specify the programming language immediately after the first set of backticks for syntax highlighting.

Here's an example in JavaScript:
<pre>

``` javascript
</pre>
```
export async function load({ params }) {
	const post = await import(`../../../code-posts/${params.slug}.md`);
	const { title, date } = post.metadata;
	const content = post.default;

	return {
		content,
		title,
		date
	};
}
```
<pre>
```
</pre>

## Conclusion

Including code blocks in your Markdown files is straightforward and enhances the readability of your technical posts.
